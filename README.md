# DAP-Project
## Semester 1 - Database and Analytical Programming Project

### Project Overview
This Python-based data analytics project is designed to streamline the process of data management across MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases. It uses adaptable Python scripts to extract and manipulate data, facilitating smooth transitions between non-relational (MongoDB) and relational (PostgreSQL) database systems. The project also leverages PostgreSQL data to create interactive visualizations in Python, enabling comprehensive data analysis.

### Key Features
- **Data Extraction and Loading**: Scripts to efficiently pull data from MongoDB and load it into PostgreSQL.
- **Data Transformation**: Includes data cleaning and transformation capabilities to ensure data integrity and relevance.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Utilization of Python visualization libraries to analyze data and generate insights dynamically.
- **Dagster Integration**: Incorporates Dagster for orchestrating workflows, managing dependencies, and maintaining robust data pipelines.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for scripting and automation.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing unstructured data.
- **PostgreSQL**: SQL database employed for structured data storage.
- **Dagster**: Workflow orchestration tool to manage pipelines efficiently.

### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
